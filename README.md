# RustySnake
WIP - snake game written in rust and ncurse

Still in a very early stage of development, currently you can:
* move the snake with the arrow keys in all directions
* snake can continue traveling to the opposite side as soon as they hit the edge. I don't like ending the game when the snake hits the wall/edge.
* snake can go back in reverse direction
* speed increases if moving in the same direction
* `pause` is supported and can be toggled usinf the `space` key to pause or resume the game
